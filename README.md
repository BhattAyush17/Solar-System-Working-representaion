THE SOLAR SYSTEM REPRESENTATION


A visual simulation of the solar system created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
<!-- Replace this with a screenshot or gif of your project -->



🚀 Project Overview
This project represents the solar system in a visually appealing and dynamic manner. It includes the Sun and planets such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, all orbiting around the Sun. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on CSS animations to simulate the planetary orbits.

Features:
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.
Planetary Orbits: The planets orbit around the Sun at varying speeds, imitating their relative positions and movement.
Planet Information: Displays the names of each planet as they orbit.
Animation: Smooth animations using CSS @keyframes and properties like offset-path.

🔧 Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the web page.
CSS3: Styling and animations to create planet orbits, sizes, and responsiveness.
JavaScript: Handling dynamic content and future enhancements (if applicable).
⚙️ How to Run the Project Locally
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/BhattAyush17/solar-system-representation.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd solar-system-representation
Open the index.html file in your browser:

bash
Copy code
open index.html
Alternatively, you can use a live server extension in VSCode or any other local development server to view the project.

🌟 How It Works
HTML: The HTML defines the structure of the solar system, with each planet and the Sun represented by list items (<li>).

CSS: Each planet's orbit and movement is powered by CSS animations. The @keyframes rule is used to simulate the planets revolving around the Sun. The planets have different colors, sizes, and speeds, mimicking their relative characteristics in the actual solar system.

JavaScript (optional for future enhancements): You can add interactivity, such as showing more details when a user clicks on a planet, or even allowing the user to change the view.

📂 Project Structure

🌍 Responsive Design
This project is designed to be responsive. The solar system layout adapts based on the screen size, ensuring a consistent user experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

🛠️ Future Enhancements
Add more details for each planet (e.g., distance from the Sun, number of moons).
Allow zooming in and out of planets for a more interactive experience.
Introduce more accurate scaling of planet sizes and orbital distances.
Implement a night mode toggle to switch between light and dark modes.
